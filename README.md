## What should it be?

- Go is simple to learn, but nuanced to master. The difference between "working code" and "idiomatic code" often lies in details such as safety, memory efficiency, and concurrency control.

- This repository is a collection of **Daily Katas**: small, standalone coding challenges designed to drill specific Go patterns into your muscle memory.

## What should it NOT be?

- This is not intended to teach coding, nor to use Go as a general-purpose learning vehicle. It is not intended to teach Go **in general**.

- The focus should be, as much as possible, on challenging oneself to solve common software engineering problems **the Go way**.

- Several seasoned developers spend years learning and applying best practices in production-grade contexts. When they decide to switch to Go, they often face two challenges:

  - Is there a way to transfer knowledge so that I don’t have to throw away years of experience and start from zero?

  - If yes, which parts should I focus on to recognize mismatches and use them the expected way in the Go ecosystem?

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Pick a Kata:** Navigate to any `XX-kata-yy` folder.
2. **Read the Challenge:** Open the `README.md` inside that folder. It defines the goal, the constraints, and the "idiomatic patterns" you must use.
3. **Solve It:** Initialize a module inside the folder and write your solution.
4. **Reflect:** Compare your solution with the provided "Reference Implementation" (if available) or the core patterns listed.
